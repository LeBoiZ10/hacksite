This is a fork virus webpage. It works by replicating itself until the victim's machine runs out of resources to continue. 
The index.html uses the websiteScript javascript file, which is obfuscated, to make it harder to read the javascript code. 
This, as well as the less obvious name, make it less obvious that the website is harmful. 
The basic javascript code is in the forkVirus javascript file - feel free to read it. 
This serves as a great reminder - remember to keep your popups blocked!
